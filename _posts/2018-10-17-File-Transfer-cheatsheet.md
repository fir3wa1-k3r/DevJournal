### There are a lot many ways to tranfer a file from one machine to a remote or a local machine in a Linux terminal. Here are a few of them which may help you when you are stuck. Before starting i would like to thank **ippsec** for all these tricks. Thank you man, Kudos to you!!!

	You can use the Python's SimpleHTTPServer module for this particular technique. First you need to fire up the
    python's HTTP server using the command `$python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. The `-m` is a switch to specify the
    module python and there you can run this command directly on your shell.
